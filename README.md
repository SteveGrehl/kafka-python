# kafka-python
Just some tutorial code for Kafka streaming in Python

## Scope
This code is my implementation for the **Udemy** course on *Kafka* by [Stephane Maarek](https://github.com/simplesteph).
You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/). However, the code will be written in Java. Hence, I wrote this code to accompany the course with Python.

## Requirements

Python packages:
- [confluent_kafka](https://pypi.org/project/confluent-kafka/) - To access [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka)
- [aiosseclient](https://pypi.org/project/aiosseclient/) - For the wikimedia example
